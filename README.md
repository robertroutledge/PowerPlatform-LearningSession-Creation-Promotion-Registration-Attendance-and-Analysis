# PowerPlatform-LearningSession-Creation-Promotion-Registration-Attendance-and-Analysis
I used PowerPlatforms to enable an employer of over 1,000 people to:
1) Have anyone submit a professional development session they would like to run via MS Forms
2) Have that form enable a dialogue with a member of the learning services team, who would then submit a form that triggered the "CreateTrainingSessionCalendarfromForm" flow
3) Send a weekly email to Managers promoting sessions taking place two to three weeks away using SendWeeklyPromotionalEmailbyCategory flow
4) Allow people to register at any time for a session using an MS Form by a Form that triggered the ParticipantRegistrationFlow
5) Allow facilitators to take atttendance using a canvass app: LearningSessionAttendanceApp
6) Send the Learning Team administrator an attendance report after the session using the SendParticipantAttendanceReport Flow

Finally, in real time, the data collected in the sharepoint lists was used to create the Power BI report that I have attached screenshots of.
